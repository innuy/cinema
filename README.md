It is a cinema management system thought to be capable of making ticket reservations. 
In order to do it, it first shows all the available movies. When the movie is selected it's time to select the auditorium seat from the available ones, all the seats are shown in the auditorium screen with the reserved ones in red.

The administrators have access to a dashboard with the next presentations, they can get a list of all presentations, auditoriums, tickets, movies and users and create, modify or delete them.
For all auditoriums, presentations and movies there are statistics using the tickets sold like auditorium utilization rates, and presentation timeline for each auditorium.
